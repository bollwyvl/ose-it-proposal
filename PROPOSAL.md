# Proposal: IT Roadmap for Open Source Ecology

## Need Statement
Open Source Ecology, through its use of many disparate on [opensourceecology.org][ose]-hosted and Software-as-a-Service tools, hampers engagement of new users by presenting a diffuse user experience. Once/if engaged, many hurdles still remain for a contributor in the form of design tools which don't meet the [GVCS core principals][principals], and a lack of visibility across the OSE enterprise.

## Goals
To improve the functionality, usability, and adherence to the [core principals][], a phased approach to consolidation of collaboration tools is proposed, with the linked goals of:

- _ose.org 2.0_: A modular, unified collaboration web site with all data from existing tools
- _OSE Linux_: An OSE-branded Free Software Operating System distribution suitable for use by collaborators
- _Data Cube_: A GVCS Tool which can meet the day-to-day computing needs of a Village

## Status Quo
- [main marketing website][ose]
    - tool: wordpress
- [wiki][]
    - tool: MediaWiki
- [forum][]
    - tool: Vanilla
- near-realtime collaboration

- [agile process][scrumy]
    - tool: scrumy
