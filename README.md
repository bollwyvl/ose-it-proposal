# What is this?
Based on discussions on the [Open Source Ecology Forum][post], several OSE
users have decided to propose a plan for helping OSE in the way that they know
how: through improvement of collaboration by means of internet-based
technology.

# What will we do with this?
Once it looks good, we'll submit it to OSE for review.

# What needs to be done?
Check the [issues](https://github.com/bollwyvl/ose-it-proposal/issues)! Let's 
keep meta-crosstalk out of the proposal.

# How do I use this repository?

I know what I want to say:

- Fork the repo, and edit [PROPOSAL.md](PROPOSAL.md)!
- Add your name to [CONTRIBUTORS](CONTRIBUTORS)
- Submit pull requests, or email patches!

I know something needs to be said:

- Create an [issue](https://github.com/bollwyvl/ose-it-proposal/issues)!
